# ABOUT THIS APP

This portfolio application is my first attempt at using JavaScript or React.  Through Youtube tutorials, a lot of googling and reasearch, and lots of debugging I am proud of the final product.
<br>
<br>
This app utilizes Routes through react-router-dom to have pages for Home, About, Skills, Portfolio, and Contact.  Each page is its own component and contains something unique.  

<br>
<br>
The About page contains info about myself beyond what I can fit into a resume as well as a custom cube animation.

<br>
<br>
The Skills page showcases what I am currently learning and the skills, languages, frameworks and more that I am confident in.

<br>
<br>
The Portfolio page contains cards with images, descriptions, and links to some of my favorite projects/applications.

<br>
<br>

Finally, the contact me page uses email.js to allow users to send me an email directly from a form on the page.  The page also has an interactive map showing where I am currently located.
